**Translations of 42Wallet:** We can only verify the validity and accuracy of the information provided in English and, because of this, the English version of our website is the official text.

**Always backup your keys / secret phrase:** 42Wallet is not a "web wallet". You do not create an account or give us your Ether or other crypto currency / tokens to hold onto. All data never leaves your computer/your browser. We make it easy for you to create, save, and access your information and interact with the blockchain.

**We are not responsible for any loss:** Ethereum, 42Wallet, and all of the underlying Javascript libraries we use are under active development. While we have tested there is always the possibility that something unexpected happens that causes your ETH or other crypto currency / tokens to be lost. Please do not invest more than you are willing to lose, and please be careful. If something were to happen, we are sorry, but we are not responsible for the lost ETH or other crypto currency / tokens.
